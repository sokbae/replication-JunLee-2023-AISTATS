# Replication: Jun and Lee (2023, AISTATS)

Replication files for all numerical results in Jun and Lee (2023, AISTATS).

## Overview

This folder contains files to replicate results from the following paper:

Sung Jae Jun and Sokbae Lee. 2023. Average Adjusted Association: Efficient Estimation with High Dimensional Confounders. <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14048>. Accepted for presentation at the _25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics_ (AISTATS 2023).

The latest version of the paper is included in this Github repository
(see paper.pdf).

## Replication Code

- The numerical results are produced using R. 

- First, [download this repository](https://github.com/sokbae/replication-JunLee-2023-AISTATS/archive/main.zip). 

- Before running the R code, it is necessary to set the working directory in each R file. For example, the following sets the directory at "experiments":

``` r
# need to set the working directory 
setwd("experiments")
```

- The data files are in the subdirectory "data".

- The R source code is in the subdirectory "src".

- The estimation results are saved in the subdirectory "results".
